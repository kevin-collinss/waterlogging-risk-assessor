## Overview
This application uses a combination of geospatial analysis, database queries, and a machine-learning model to classify flood risk. The system is designed to be both user-friendly and technically robust.

## Data Sources
- **Soil Data:** Provided by a national soil survey, containing texture, depth, and descriptive information.
- **Hydrology Data:** Contains drainage category, material descriptions, and hydrological properties.
- **Elevation Data:** Derived from a digital elevation model, offering precise altitude measurements for each coordinate.
- **Rainfall Data:** Yearly, seasonal, and monthly rainfall patterns used to evaluate potential flood risks.

## Machine Learning Model
The classification model is trained on historical flood incidents and relevant environmental features. It uses a combination of random forest and other ensemble methods to generate cluster predictions.

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical features, scaling numerical values.
2. **Model Training:** Combining multiple algorithms to find the best accuracy.
3. **Prediction:** Returning a cluster label that indicates the flood risk category.

## System Architecture
1. **Frontend (React):** Handles map interactions, sidebar data display, and user clicks.
2. **Backend (Node/Python):** Receives easting/northing, queries a PostGIS database, and runs the model inference.
3. **Database (PostGIS):** Stores soil, hydrology, elevation, and rainfall data in spatial tables for efficient querying.

## Future Work
- Integration of real-time rainfall data.
- Enhanced machine learning model with deep learning approaches.
- Improved user interface with custom polygons and field boundary detection.
